**Welcome to the final project of Seona Patel, Sudev Namboodiri, and Richard Dean!**

In this project, we are analyzing the specific differences in measured variables between Demented subjects and Non-demented subjects to see whether these variables have any predictive value in developing Alzheimer's Disease Dementia.
